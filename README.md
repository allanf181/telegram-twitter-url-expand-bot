# Link Expander ‚Äî Telegram Bot for expanding Twitter, Instagram, Hacker News, and TikTok links.

![banner-4 1@1x](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6843656/214646426-db3bf292-afc4-4729-8e16-64ed687127aa.png)

Some Twitter links stopped expanding inside Telegram which made it extremely annoying when you wanted to send a banger tweet to your homies in the group chat. This bot replies with an alternative [fxtwitter.com](https://fxtwitter.com) URL which has a working embed for multiple photos and even includes inline video.

## Supports Hacker News links! (not in channels yet)

You can now expand Hacker News links. It will reply with the original YCombinator URL, the link shared in a HN post, and the title of the submission.

While it is technically possible through the Bot API, I simply do not have the time or desire to snoop on your shit. The only thing I will keep track of is counting anonymous events when buttons are clicked, bot commands are used, a tweet has multiple images (etc.) to monitor stats to see if people are finding this bot useful.
